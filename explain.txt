1. Defining the boiler plate
2. Defining all the global unction that are being used withint the code.
3. Creating a structure data type and defining some variable.
4. Defing the main function.
5. withint the main function we created a system that take an input from accordint to action of the application(1 for addrecord, 2 for viewrecord, 3 for editrecord, 4 for deleterecord, 5 for editpassword, 6 for exit)
6. Defining the addrecord function for adding note withint the application

//*** Structure and function ***//
A structure is a user define data type that can be used to group element of different types into a single type.
    struct student {
        char name[10]
        int age;
        int roll_no;
        float marks;
    }

    how to invoke this structure data within the function
    int main(){
        struct student s1 = {"Nick", 16, 50, 72.5};
        print(s1.name, s1.age, s1.roll_no, s1.marks)
    }

    void print(char name[], int age, int roll, float marks){
        printf("%s, %d, %d, %.2f", name, age, roll, marks)
    }
